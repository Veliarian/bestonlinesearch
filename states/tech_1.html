                <h2>Smart Tips to Grow Your Business Online</h2>
                <div id="content-main" class="left relative">
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few people have thousands of dollars to put into growing their own online business. But, the truth is that, you can do a lot without spending money. All it takes is effort, creativity, and imagination. In this article, we’re going to show you how to grow an online business for free. Here are some tips to help you begin.</span>
                    <h4><b>Deliver High-Quality Content</b></h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Making high-quality content is very important, whether it’s a blog or a product description. You must engage your audience and give them what they need the most, ie. information. This information should be delivered in a way that keeps readers interested. Separating points with headers and keeping the language easy to understand is only the beginning. Another important aspect when it comes to quality content is, remaining factual. Always base your content on reliable evidence, otherwise, it’s just “fake news”.</span>
                    <h4><b>Site Speed</b></h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Most users interact with content on their mobile devices. So, if your content takes more than three seconds to load, the user will lose interest. If your site is like this, it needs to be optimized for speed.</span>
                    <h4><b>Avoid Fluffing</b></h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to not try too hard to achieve a certain word count. This could lead to what’s known as, “fluff.” Fluff doesn’t seem to have any other purpose other than stretching out how many words are on a page. Using too much fluff can confuse your readers as well as search engine bots.</span>
                    <h4><b>Be Mobile-Friendly</b></h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business needs to have a mobile-friendly site today. Here are some points to keep in mind, so that you can be mobile-friendly.</span>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">-No flash video</span>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">-Optimize your images</span>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">-Have tappable elements</span>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">-Make sure your navigation and functionality is easy&nbsp;</span>
                    <h4><b>Integrate Social Media</b></h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is a very effective tool to grow your business without actually spending money. It’s completely free to create a profile on most platforms. This means that you can easily put the business in front of thousands of potential consumers in no time.</span>
                    <h4><b>Adding Daily Posts</b></h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of posts you should put up each day depends on the type of business that you have. While some people do five or more, others do well with just one post. Basically, you need to be active, if you want attention from your audience.</span>
