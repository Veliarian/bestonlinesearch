                <h2>Meet the New 2021 Ford F-150</h2>
                <p>When you think of pickup trucks, you think of Ford. The iconic automotive company is as American as
                    apple pie. It’s long been an institution here in this country — and for good reason. Ford produces
                    exceptional vehicles at very affordable prices. The year 2021 will be no different. Slated to come
                    out with the 2021 Ford F-150, consumers will be thrilled to learn about all of the bells and
                    whistles of this brand-new vehicle.</p>
                <p><strong>Types</strong></p>

                <p>There are a number of different options underneath the 2021 F-150 umbrella. They include XL
                    ($30,635), XLT ($36,745), Lariat ($46,390), King Ranch ($58,025), Platinum ($60,805), and Limited
                    ($72,520). As is the case with most years, consumers will have their options of engines as well.
                    Regardless, each car will be constructed with a 10-speed automatic. Other engines available include
                    a twin-turbocharged 2.7-L V-6 with 325-HP, a 3.5-L V-6 with 400-HP, a 3.7-L V-6 with 290-HP, and a
                    3.0-L V-6 with 250-HP. Ford reportedly has invested $500 million into the electric vehicle
                    manufacturer Rivian — which leads people to believe that an all-electric Ford product could be soon
                    on the market.</p>

                <p><strong>Other Metrics</strong></p>

                <p>Ford is developing something called a PowerBoost hybrid powertrain. According to reports, this
                    newfound piece of technology (a 3.5-L PowerBoost full hybrid V-6 engine) would allow the F-150 to
                    travel 700 miles on one tank of gas. It also includes 570 lb.-ft. of torque and 430 HP. This would
                    be revolutionary — particularly for those transport drivers who lug materials large distances on a
                    daily basis. There are also fuel-saving components which protect the vehicle’s ability to conserve
                    gas. As Ford remarks on their company website, this new model is “Tougher Than Before” as well as
                    “Smarter Than Ever.” This surely has to do with the redesigned methods of conserving fuel.</p>


                <p>Durability shouldn’t be a question with this car, either. According to Ford, the vehicles are
                    fashioned with a military-grade, aluminum-alloy body. When factoring in the engine versatility —
                    coupled with the towing capabilities — the 2021 Ford F-150 is ready for any sort of rough and tumble
                    adventure thrown its way.</p>

                <p><strong>Interior</strong></p>

                <p>The interior of the vehicle surely has improved from past models. Inside, you’ll find a comfortable,
                    decadent, yet practical inner cab. There are Max Recline Seats which fold nearly completely flat.
                    One can relax in the car with a quick nap — or use this extra space to carry more materials. There’s
                    also rear seat storage with a lock and key (in the floor). This is a tremendous facet for the driver
                    who’d like to keep his essentials hidden and private as opposed to exposed when the car is parked.
                    Lastly, the interior cab also has the Standard SYNC — a touchscreen system with voice recognition,
                    cloud-based connectivity, and all of the conveniences of a truly modern vehicle. Some models even
                    allow those in the car to stream videos.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

                <p>Without question, the 2021 Ford F-150 appears primed to be a leader on the market when compared to
                    its peers. Not only is it a fashionable and quite sleek vehicle, but it possesses the functionality
                    of a sturdy pickup truck without sacrificing style, ingenuity, or technology. In total, it seems
                    like the perfect package for one who wants a dynamic pickup truck.</p>
